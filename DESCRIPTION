Description: "easi" is a package for R enabling the estimation of the Exact
    Affine Stone Index demand system of Pendakur and Lewbel (2009). However,
    more than just a transcript, it offers a number of extensions in an unified
    framework. Firstly, it allows to calculate elasticities (income
    elasticities, price elasticities and demographic elasticities) and their
    standard deviations. Secondly, it enables the calculation and the graphical
    representation of Engel curves and their confidence interval. Thirdly, it
    provides simulation tools to assess the impact of price changes, income
    changes and demographic changes on fitted budget shares, elasticities, and
    their standard deviations. Finally, easi allows the computation of
    equivalent incomes.
